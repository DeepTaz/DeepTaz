## Deep Taz

Hi! I'm Deep Taz, and you can find me under the account name "Taz". I work as a developer, creator.

`` I love "web". ``

Do you like the web?

I have grown up with the growth of "web". I've developed various mash-up services, user-generated content systems, web APIs for mobile apps, and practical CLI tools. Most are like junk, junk, junk... But a few have been utilized by people and have even changed some lives. I'll keep contributing to web.

Just for fun.

Didn't you hear those words somewhere?

I want to be like that teenager who's just starting out with a guitar, eager to own one. He saves up, buys a new acoustic guitar, and then plays Led Zeppelin's "Tangerine" in a park on a mountain top until his hands ache. Just for fun.
